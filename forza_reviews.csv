It's not a terrible game and would be good if you never played any of the prequels but Horizon 4 was better.,159.6,0
The graphics are great. The car selection wide. But I think I am just too old for this one. Arcade racing taken to the extreme - keep it flat to the floor and don't worry about a thing,0.6,0
Yea i'm up 300h but i don't recommend this game  because it's been out a while now  and it's still crashing way too many times,371.3,0
This game is fun and pretty at first  most of that due to the wow factor of the intro and the few subsequent races and stories but it gets stale fast after that. ,59.7,0
It has no sense of progression no actual storyline and the dialogues,55.7,0
I wait so long time then this game got crash after launching. ,0.9,0

I cannot reccomend this game to anyone looking to enjoy a good racing experience; go play assestto corsa or BeamNG even.,291.5,0
Its just the same game again and giving us last years cars as unlocks is just lazy.,62.9,0
This game has all the aspects to be amazingly fun yet the core gameplay and the way it has been structured makes it a very underwhelming experience.,28.6,0
cars feel like they have no weight to them and to much wheel spin when driving,134.4,0
Great game but nearly unplayable because of the unskippable long and incredibly annoying cutscenes,7.7,0
I really enjoy this game and its stupendously large vehicle list but playing the game on a racing rig is horribly unforgiving frustrating and downright enjoyable 90% of the time.,89.4,0
Loading the game I spend more time than driving,81.1,0
no steering wheel the wheels are bad in this game and you can get banned for no reason,13.2,0
Cars all feel exactly the same  no real incentive to progress since they give you top tier cars right out of the gate and the AI is dumb as hell and has a ton of rubber banding,5.0,0
Game crashes too much on startup and doing game play.,5.0,0
Played the rally adventure.....It wasn't really that fun.,5.6,0
apparently don't have enough graphic quality to load the game and keeps crashing,4.5,0
Microsoft does not allow save transfers from Game Pass,0.4,0

Bought car pass promised all packs free expected to pay for latest car pass ,207.5,0
my game suddenly not allowing me start the game,109.0,0
Save your money just buy the previous game,4.9,0
Can't recommend. I guess it's OK but the game is a full downgrade from FH4 in almost every aspect except maybe graphics but I can't tell,20.3,0
Game does nt work i played for long time to find the bugs game always crashes when i asked for refund the refund was cancelled do not download this game its a trash ,15.1,0
a racing wheel feels terrible in this game compared to other racing games,0.6,0
I don't like this game because is boring,8.4,0
Game is a clone of the previous It's alright. ,125.1,0
You spend more time watching loading screens than racing.,247.6,0
gets boring very fast,2.3,0
It took me 10 mins to figure out how to drive a car. Everywhere I go I have to buy a car.,6.4,0
At the moment I'm struggling to recommend this game not because it isn't amazing - it's so much fun - BUT - it's crashing,46.9,0

Couldn't even drive 1 meter without having to deal with a bug. What a joke.,0.5,0
you'll play it for 1 month straight and get bored then never play it again don't buy it.,280.8,0
game keeps crashing and making it very disappointing after making the complete purchase and its unplayable. ,5.9,0
game keeps on crashing ,70.3,0
The cars in this game do NOT drive well. The drifting feels AWFUL.  ,1.2,0
a game that looks like it was made to produce a good trailer and that's all. ,10.7,0
I regret buying this then just leaving it running as I can't return it now.,5.6,0
